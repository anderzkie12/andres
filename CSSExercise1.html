      <p>
        There are many different varieties of Japanese apples, with the majority being produced in the northern prefecture of Aomori.
        <strong> Some of the top varieties include Fuji, which occupies about 50 percent of Japanâ€™s current market share. </strong>
        <em>Fuji apples </em> have become popular across the world because of their crisp texture and sweet taste. 
        They are a crossbreed of two American strains, Red Delicious and Ralls Janet, but have taken on a very individual identity.
